      "parameter": "HbA1c (GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN)",
      "interpretation": "Your HbA1c level of 6.5% is in the diagnostic range for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. This indicates that your average blood sugar levels have been elevated over the past 2-3 months, despite a normal fasting glucose reading on the day of the test. This discrepancy suggests that your blood sugar may be spiking after meals or at other times, which is not captured by a single fasting measurement.",
      "correlation": "The high HbA1c, combined with a normal fasting glucose, points towards a pattern of uncontrolled post-meal glucose levels or early-stage diabetes where fasting glucose might still be compensated. This finding is critical and requires immediate medical attention.",
      "severity": "CRITICAL. This is a new diagnosis of diabetes, which carries significant long-term health risks if not managed effectively.",
      "monitoring": "Immediate consultation with an endocrinologist or primary care physician is recommended. Regular monitoring of HbA1c (every 3-6 months), daily blood glucose monitoring, and comprehensive diabetes management are essential."

    {
      "parameter": "Vitamin D, 25 Hydroxy",
      "interpretation": "Your Vitamin D level of 23.82 nmol/L is severely deficient. Optimal levels are generally considered above 75 nmol/L. This deficiency can significantly impact bone health, immune function, and overall energy levels.",
      "correlation": "Severe Vitamin D deficiency can contribute to general fatigue and muscle weakness, which might be compounded by the metabolic stress of newly diagnosed diabetes. It can also affect calcium absorption, potentially leading to bone density issues.",
      "severity": "HIGH. This level indicates a significant deficiency requiring prompt intervention.",
      "monitoring": "Supplementation with high-dose Vitamin D (under medical supervision) is strongly recommended. Follow-up testing of Vitamin D levels should be done after 1-3 months of supplementation to ensure levels are rising appropriately."

      "parameter": "Vitamin B12; Cyanocobalamin",
      "interpretation": "Your Vitamin B12 level of 202.0 pg/mL is low, falling just below the normal reference range. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and potentially neurological issues if not corrected.",
      "correlation": "Vitamin B12 deficiency can contribute to fatigue and weakness, which are common symptoms that can also be associated with uncontrolled diabetes. Addressing this deficiency can improve overall energy and neurological health.",
      "severity": "MODERATE. While not critically low, it is below the optimal range and warrants attention.",
      "monitoring": "Oral Vitamin B12 supplementation is typically effective. Follow-up testing of B12 levels is recommended after 1-3 months of supplementation to ensure adequate absorption and normalization of levels."
